# Introduction

Welcome to the QBilling API. It will provide you access to universal billing system that is usage-agnostic, what makes it suitable for financial companies for storing accounts and transferring money, games with inner currency or anyone else who have balance and any actions with it.

# Key Features

### Data Retention Policy

We believe that vendor-lock is a bad thing, thats why you are free to download all data from your account in a JSON format.

Also you can remove all you data from our servers. After your confirm data remove process in Dashboard we will keep everything for additional 30 days, so your account will be protected from accidental removals. After 30 days all data will be scrubbed and impossible to restore.

### API-oriented

We are API-centered, that means that we are trying to make it simple, easy to understand, and yet very powerful.

### Crossintegrations

We support hustle-free integration with oAuth providers. See more at [Integrating oAuth provider](#integrating-oauth-provider) section.

Also we support custom webhook integrations in a SOA-style. This will help you to add any puzzle-pieces that you may need: users storage, antifraud systems, data storages, scoring systems, etc.

### Project scopes

We allow you to create separated projects in case you need them for different test or production environments.
