# Projects
To start using our application you need to create a project. Project is a special scope that stores all data in it. It allows you to separate different accounts between different access scopes.

For example it can be used for eWallet white-labels, where each app have all data in separate.

All accounts already have a bootstrapped project for a development purposes.
